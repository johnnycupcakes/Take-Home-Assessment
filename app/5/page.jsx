      <h3>Imagine that the customer from Question 4 responds with the following email.<br />
      “I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”</h3>

      <p>Hello,
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you for your reply.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am genuinely sorry to hear that the instructions didn't work as expected, and I understand your frustration. It took me a while to get up and running, and I will ensure you are 100% satisfied before closing this ticket.

      I am not able to access your account. However, we can troubleshoot in real-time using a video call service of your choice, or if you prefer to do things asynchronously, I can record a video of the process from within my account. Please let me know what option works best, and I await your reply. Talk to you soon!</p>
