      Hello,
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you for writing in today.

      My name is Nic, and I will handle your support request. You would like your project not to be indexed by search engines. No problem at all!

      Please use an x-robots-tag: noindex header to prevent the site from being indexed. Vercel does this automatically for Preview deployments to avoid negative SEO impact from duplicate content. The FAQ article below contains additional information.
