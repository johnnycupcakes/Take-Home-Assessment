      <h2>Question 2</h2>
      <h3>How would you compare Next.js with another framework? Feel free to compare with a framework of your choice.</h3>
      <br />
      <p>I want to compare Next.js with Angular. Both frameworks use component-based architecture, support client-side rendering, and support Typescript. However, Angular is built entirely on Typescript, while Next.js offers a Typescript-integrated experience. The most significant difference is that Next.js offers server-side rendering, while Angular does not provide server-side rendering by default. Since Next.js has server-side rendering capabilities and code splitting, it helps minimize page loading time and beats Angular in performance.</p>
